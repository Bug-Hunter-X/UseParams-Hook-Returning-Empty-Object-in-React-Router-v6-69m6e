In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that is not directly a child of a route matching the parameters may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The `useParams` hook relies on the routing context provided by the nearest parent route. If the component is nested too deeply or rendered outside of this context, `useParams` will return an empty object, leading to unexpected behavior and errors.
